In a classic wet process, the pulped coffee rests in a tank while naturally present microorganisms and enzymes help loosen that mucilage. Some systems remove it mechanically instead. Even within the category “washed,” equipment, water use, fermentation conditions, soaking, and timing can differ.",
          "When the mucilage has loosened, the parchment coffee is washed. Channels can also help sort it by density as water carries lighter material differently from denser coffee. The result is not a finished green bean. It is wet parchment that must still be dried with care.",
          "Drying may happen on raised racks, tables, patios, or mechanical systems. On open drying surfaces, coffee is spread, turned, protected from rain or harsh conditions, and monitored as its moisture falls. A raised bed improves airflow and access, but it does not do the work by itself. Layer depth, turning, weather, and the decision about when drying is complete still matter.",
          "Fermentation also deserves more precision than the old idea that it is simply a countdown. Research summarized by the Specialty Coffee Association shows that microbial activity and the seed’s own metabolism both change during processing. Longer or shorter is not automatically better.

That infrastructure helped make the washed style familiar to buyers and drinkers far beyond Kenya.",
          "Familiar, however, is not exclusive. The same official industry guidance also lists natural, honey, and newer fermentation approaches in Kenya. A country is not a process, and a process is not a national flavor. Washed coffee became an important way that Kenyan coffee entered the specialty market, not a rule that every Kenyan coffee must follow.",
          "There is also an environmental dimension. Wet processing uses water and creates fruit-rich wastewater that must be managed. Good processing is therefore not only a sensory question. It involves water access, equipment maintenance, by-product handling, and decisions that affect the working site around the coffee.",

The work aimed to bring productivity and resistance to coffee berry disease together with useful cup quality. Calling all three simply “classic Kenyan varieties” hides different histories, plant forms, and agronomic roles.",

          "A landrace is generally understood as a crop population maintained and shaped over time in a local farming system. Adaptation is part of the idea, but so is human selection. Farmers choose seed, keep plants that perform, exchange material, and name types through knowledge that may not match a formal genetic catalog.",
          "A local selection begins when particular plants are chosen from a broader population for useful traits. A research selection applies more formal testing and distribution. Ethiopia’s coffee research institutions have collected, conserved, selected, and released varieties, including material chosen for disease resistance, yield, and quality. Those coffees are Ethiopian, but it would be inaccurate to call every one an unidentified heirloom.",
          "The distinction matters because a catch-all word can hide agricultural knowledge. It can erase farmer names for plant types and obscure the work of Ethiopian breeders and genebanks. Precision is not about replacing one broad term with another. It is about using the most specific language the evidence allows.",

        paragraphs: [
          "Coffee variety identification can draw on farmer knowledge, plant shape, fruit and leaf traits, collection records, and genetic testing. Those sources do not always align. Two plants can look similar and have different genetic histories; one named type can contain more variation than a commercial label suggests.",
          "Genebanks use the word accession for a collected sample held as a distinct entry. An accession is not automatically a commercial variety. It may be one plant, seed from a population, or material kept for future research. The large number of accessions conserved from Ethiopia demonstrates the scale of research material, not a count of consumer-ready variety names.",
          "Mixtures add another layer. Coffee from several small plots may enter one station lot. A plot may contain more than one plant type. Unless the chain can identify and keep a specific variety separate, the honest label may remain broad. “Local landraces and selections” can be more informative than heirloom, but it is still a category, not a genetic result.",
          "Good labeling therefore includes the limit of knowledge. “Variety not specified” is not a failure when the information is genuinely unavailable. False precision is worse because it turns an assumption into product fact.",

        paragraphs: [
          "Sidama and Guji are distinct coffee geographies in southern Ethiopia. Ethiopian research collections treat them as separate sources of germplasm, alongside Gedeo, Amaro, Gamo Gofa, Jinka, and other areas. That makes the regional name meaningful information about where a coffee comes from.",
          "It does not make Sidama synonymous with jasmine or Guji synonymous with strawberry. Each contains multiple districts, elevations, farms, plant populations, stations, seasons, and post-harvest practices. Research in southern Ethiopia has found variation among genotypes and environments, which is the opposite of a fixed regional flavor rule.",
          "The best use of geography is to narrow the field. Country becomes region; region may become zone, district, station, cooperative, or farm when the supply chain can support it. Each added level gives the drinker more context, but none removes the need to taste the individual coffee.",

          "In washed processing, the fruit skin and most mucilage are removed before the parchment coffee is dried. In natural processing, the whole cherry dries around the seed before hulling. The difference changes where fermentation occurs and how the seed responds during drying.",
          "That makes process useful on a bag. It can help a drinker compare two coffees from the same country or region. It still cannot carry the full explanation. Fruit maturity, plant material, temperature, microbes, drying rate, storage, roasting, and brewing all affect what reaches the cup.",
          "The familiar contrast—washed is floral and clean, natural is fruity and heavy—may describe some coffees. It cannot define the categories. A carefully handled natural can be delicate; a washed coffee can be full and fruit-saturated. Read the process beside the producer’s or roaster’s specific notes, not in place of them.",

          "The pair is useful because it does not ask “heirloom” to explain either coffee. Sidama and Guji locate them at a regional level. Washed and natural describe the broad post-harvest route. The tasting notes help a visitor choose between Red Clay’s two profiles. Exact variety detail should enter only when the coffee can support it.",

A named variety, local selection, landrace group, mixed planting, or unspecified variety are different levels of information.",
          "Then read process. Washed, natural, honey, and newer fermentation terms should tell you something about fruit removal and drying, but the word alone does not certify quality. Finally, use tasting notes as sensory references from the roaster. They describe resemblance and direction, not ingredients added to the coffee.",
          "If a bag says heirloom, treat it as an invitation to ask what is known underneath: local landraces, named farmer selections, research varieties, a mixture, or simply incomplete identification. The answer may still be broad. What matters is that the language does not pretend to be narrower than the evidence.",
          "One convenient word once helped the coffee trade speak about complexity it had not fully named. Better information now allows a more useful habit: keep the complexity, lose the false certainty, and let each coffee tell a more specific story.",
