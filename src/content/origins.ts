    place: "Kiambu and Kirinyaga sit within Kenya’s central coffee-growing highlands. Farms and cooperative factories vary in scale, but coffee moves through an agricultural landscape shaped by cultivation, selective picking, and primary processing close to where the cherries are grown.",
    context: "SL28 and SL34 were selected in Kenya in the 1930s. Ruiru 11, a compact composite hybrid released in 1985, was developed later for productivity and resistance to coffee berry disease. These names can help describe the plant material in a coffee, but they do not predict the finished cup on their own.",
    process: "In a common washed sequence, ripe cherries are sorted and depulped. Fermentation or mechanical demucilaging removes the sticky mucilage around the seed. The parchment coffee is then washed, sorted again, and dried. Kenya also produces natural, honey, and other process styles, so “Kenyan” and “washed” are not interchangeable terms.",
    work: "Clarity begins before water reaches a tank. Picking maturity, removing damaged fruit, monitoring fermentation, washing evenly, and controlling the drying layer all affect the condition of the green coffee. Each stage calls for observation and adjustment rather than one fixed recipe.",
    cup: "Plum Season, from Kiambu, moves through blackcurrant, plum, and cane sugar with a bright, structured line. Cane Light, from Kirinyaga, is the more lifted comparison, with red currant, hibiscus, and pomelo.",

    },
    place: "In Kayanza, coffee is grown across steep, densely cultivated hills. A farmer may tend a relatively small stand of trees, then deliver ripe cherry to a nearby washing station. That movement from dispersed plots to a shared processing site is central to how much Burundian coffee is organized.",
    context: "Bourbon-type Arabica is widely associated with Burundi, although the exact plant material must be verified for an individual coffee. At a washing station, deliveries from many growers can be received, sorted, and processed in daily batches. The station is not the farm; it is the point where separate harvests enter a shared sequence of equipment, water, labor, and record keeping.",
    process: "For fully washed coffee, stations can pre-sort cherry, depulp it, ferment or otherwise remove mucilage, wash the parchment, and prepare it for drying. In a natural process, the fruit remains around the seed during drying. These routes create different conditions for fermentation and drying, but neither route dictates one inevitable flavor.",
    work: "Raised beds and drying tables lift coffee away from the ground and allow air to move around it. They still require active work: controlling layer depth, turning coffee, covering it when conditions change, and removing defects. Sector records show raised-bed drying at individual Kayanza stations, but equipment and routines differ from station to station.",
    cup: "Honey Bloom is the softer, more floral choice: red apple, honey, and orange blossom. Red Orchard keeps the region in view while moving toward raspberry, black tea, and brown-sugar depth.",

    place: "Sidama and Guji are separate geographic references, each containing many growing areas, farms, plant populations, and processing sites. Research collections from southern Ethiopia treat both as distinct sources of coffee germplasm. A region name is therefore useful orientation, but it is too broad to function as a complete sensory description.",
    context: "Ethiopia is a primary center of diversity for Coffea arabica. Its coffee includes forest and semi-forest populations, farmer-maintained landraces, local selections, and varieties released through research programs. “Heirloom” cannot name all of that accurately, and even “landrace” should not be used for every Ethiopian coffee by default.",
    process: "Washed processing removes the skin and most mucilage before the seed is dried in parchment. Natural processing dries the seed inside the whole fruit before hulling. Those different conditions matter, but so do plant genetics, ripeness, fermentation management, drying, storage, roasting, and brewing.",
    work: "Sorting makes quality decisions visible. Workers separate coffee by ripeness, density, size, or visible defect at different points in the chain. The work can happen before and after drying, and it depends on people knowing which differences matter at each stage.",
