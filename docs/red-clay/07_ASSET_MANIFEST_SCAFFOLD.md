# Red Clay Coffee — Asset Manifest Scaffold

**Document version:** 1.4.0  
**Change note:** Section 6A.3 adds the approved initial implementation lock, four-state production authorization, the selected Drive archive, and explicit custom-pending families.  
**Status:** Operational Section-6 asset manifest. Initial implementation sources are locked; custom product media remains pending but does not block implementation.  
**Evidence note:** The original supplied visual files remain 10 Canyon screenshots and 2 Onyx screenshots used by the reference atlas. Section 6A additionally archived external source candidates in Google Drive. Those files are candidates—not supplied Red Clay validation imagery and not approved production assets. The Validation Pack defines target asset concepts (Assets 01–13), so `Spec` below means a written validation specification exists.

**Catalogue change note (2026-10-28):** The Current Harvest coffees were renamed in code (`src/content/coffees.ts`). Slot IDs (`KENYA`, `BURUNDI`, `ETH01`, `ETH02`) are unchanged as identifiers; descriptive labels now use current product names. With six Current Harvest coffees, the four-slot product rows below remain a scaffold.

| Former name (former slug) | Earlier working name | Current name | Current slug | Lot code in code |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| KIAMBU / WASHED 01 (`kiambu-washed-01`) | Kenya Lot 01 (`kenya-lot-01`) | Plum Season | `/shop/plum-season` | RC / CH / 01 |
| KIRINYAGA / WASHED 02 (`kirinyaga-washed-02`) | — | Cane Light | `/shop/cane-light` | RC / CH / 02 |
| KAYANZA / WASHED 01 (`kayanza-washed-01`) | Burundi Lot 01 (`burundi-lot-01`) | Honey Bloom | `/shop/honey-bloom` | RC / CH / 03 |
| KAYANZA / NATURAL 02 (`kayanza-natural-02`) | — | Red Orchard | `/shop/red-orchard` | RC / CH / 04 |
| SIDAMA / WASHED 01 (`sidama-washed-01`) | Ethiopia Lot 01 (`ethiopia-lot-01`) | Jasmine Air | `/shop/jasmine-air` | RC / CH / 05 |
| GUJI / NATURAL 02 (`guji-natural-02`) | Ethiopia Lot 02 (`ethiopia-lot-02`) | Blue Hour | `/shop/blue-hour` | RC / CH / 06 |

All former slugs permanently redirect to the current slugs (`next.config.ts`). Laterite, Basalt, Linen (The Material Series), Afterlight, Red Clay Instant — Ethiopia, Three Regions, and The Kiln Cup (handleless) are unchanged.

## Status vocabulary

- `OPEN` — slot required or optional; no final file selected.
- `REUSE TEST` — first test a related asset family before generating another file.
- `OPTIONAL` — produce only if browser composition requires it.
- `SUPERSEDED SLOT` — structural placeholder replaced by an approved experience; retain only for fallback/poster logic.
- `FINAL REQUIRED` — final coherent product/region asset will be necessary, but is not approved yet.
- `APPROVED_CURRENT` — selected for immediate implementation within its provenance constraints.
- `PROVISIONAL_REPLACEABLE` — usable now with a deliberate later replacement path.
- `REFERENCE_ONLY` — visual research only; never ship as Red Clay production media.
- `CUSTOM_ASSET_PENDING` — final fictional product media remains to be produced; use the canonical temporary-media contract.

## Asset authorization state — mandatory interpretation

Every manifest row has three independent states:

| Field | Meaning | Round 1.1 state |
|---|---|---|
| `SPEC_EXISTS` | A written target/specification exists in a canonical document. | Read from the existing `Validation spec?` or `Existing validation asset?` column; this does **not** identify a file. |
| `SOURCE_FILE_SUPPLIED` | A specific source file is assigned and archived for implementation. | `YES` for selected archived sources; `MANUAL_DOWNLOAD_REQUIRED` for `RITUAL-201`; `NO` for custom-pending and reference-only production slots. |
| `PRODUCTION_APPROVAL` | Current implementation authorization. | One of `APPROVED_CURRENT`, `PROVISIONAL_REPLACEABLE`, `REFERENCE_ONLY`, or `CUSTOM_ASSET_PENDING`. Do not reduce this to YES/NO. |

The legacy table labels `Existing validation asset?` and `Validation spec?` still mean only `SPEC_EXISTS`. Current file assignment and authorization come from the Section 6A.3 overlay below and [assets/IMPLEMENTATION_ASSET_LOCK.md](assets/IMPLEMENTATION_ASSET_LOCK.md). Never infer approval from a written spec, candidate score, or `FINAL REQUIRED` label.

## Section 6A.3 implementation authorization overlay

This overlay supersedes earlier “no approvals” statements for implementation state. Full role mapping and repository paths are in [assets/CODEX_ASSET_MAP.md](assets/CODEX_ASSET_MAP.md).

| Candidate / family | SOURCE_FILE_SUPPLIED | PRODUCTION_APPROVAL | Selected archive / implementation note |
|---|---|---|---|
| `MAT-CLAY-001` | YES | `APPROVED_CURRENT` | `Assets/SELECTED_IMPLEMENTATION/MATERIALS/MAT-CLAY-001.jpg` |
| `MAT-STONE-102` | YES | `APPROVED_CURRENT` | `Assets/SELECTED_IMPLEMENTATION/MATERIALS/MAT-STONE-102.jpg` |
| `MAT-LINEN-101` | YES | `APPROVED_CURRENT` | `Assets/SELECTED_IMPLEMENTATION/MATERIALS/MAT-LINEN-101.jpg` |
| `KEN-LAND-001` | YES | `APPROVED_CURRENT` | Kiambu context; not Nyeri/Kirinyaga. |
| `KEN-PROC-001` | YES | `APPROVED_CURRENT` | Major contextual process/editorial plate. |
| `KEN-PROC-111` | YES | `APPROVED_CURRENT` | Kiambu process/detail. |
| `KEN-PROC-115` | YES | `APPROVED_CURRENT` | Kiambu botanical/detail. |
| `BUR-LAND-001` | YES | `APPROVED_CURRENT` | Primary Kayanza/Folio lead. |
| `BUR-LAND-003` | YES | `APPROVED_CURRENT` | Banga, Burundi; do not call Kayanza. |
| `BUR-BOT-001` | YES | `APPROVED_CURRENT` | Ngozi botanical support; do not call Kayanza. |
| `ETH-PROC-103` | YES | `PROVISIONAL_REPLACEABLE` | Hawassa process image serving as initial Folio lead. |
| `ETH-PROC-104` | YES | `APPROVED_CURRENT` | Hawassa process/people support. |
| `ETH-PROC-105` | YES | `APPROVED_CURRENT` | Ethiopia country-only process/detail. |
| `RITUAL-203` | YES | `APPROVED_CURRENT` | Priority 1 ritual source. |
| `RITUAL-216` | YES | `APPROVED_CURRENT` | Priority 2 ritual source. |
| `RITUAL-201` | `MANUAL_DOWNLOAD_REQUIRED` | `APPROVED_CURRENT` | Priority 3; exact source record retained. Omit until retrieved rather than substitute. |
| `ARCH-201` | YES | `PROVISIONAL_REPLACEABLE` | Home/About architecture prototype; not a Red Clay location. |
| `PACK-201`–`PACK-205` | NO for production | `REFERENCE_ONLY` | Never use third-party packaging in the Red Clay product experience. |
| `CUP-201`–`CUP-205` | NO for production | `REFERENCE_ONLY` | Form/material reference only; not The Kiln Cup. |
| Fictional coffee packaging, packshots and alternates | NO | `CUSTOM_ASSET_PENDING` | Use temporary product-media component. *2026-10-28: the drawn packaging system (`PackageArt` / `ObjectArt`) replaced the temporary component; real Material Series packshots (`material-laterite.jpg`, `material-basalt.jpg`, `material-linen.jpg`, `material-series-trio.jpg`) ship in `public/media/red-clay/products/`. Every other bag front and back now uses photographic bag renders (`bag-<sku>-front.jpg` / `bag-<sku>-back.jpg`, plus 100 g fronts for the Three Regions packs) in `public/media/red-clay/products/`, built from the real Linen packshot: its print is removed, the paper's own grain and lighting are kept, and each SKU's colours, motif and label are reprinted through that shading. Instant and the Three Regions box remain drawn (`ObjectArt`); true photographed packshots of the printed bags remain pending.* |
| Kiln Cup imagery and `CUP-DIMENSION-GRAPHIC` | NO | `CUSTOM_ASSET_PENDING` | Use temporary media; never invent dimensions. *2026-10-28: two Kiln Cup photographs (`kiln-cup-plinth.jpg`, `kiln-cup-raking-light.jpg`) ship in `public/media/red-clay/objects/`; `CUP-DIMENSION-GRAPHIC` remains pending.* |
| Product + Cup pairing imagery, including `CUP-BUNDLE` | NO | `CUSTOM_ASSET_PENDING` | Use temporary media; do not imply a discount. |

`ASSET DISCOVERY NO LONGER BLOCKS IMPLEMENTATION.`

## Section 6A sourcing fields

The per-asset sourcing overlay is maintained in [assets/ASSET_SOURCING_MATRIX.md](assets/ASSET_SOURCING_MATRIX.md). It records every canonical asset ID with:

`SOURCE_STRATEGY`, `SOURCE_PROVIDER`, `SOURCE_URL`, `CREATOR`, `LICENSE`, `ATTRIBUTION_REQUIRED`, `ATTRIBUTION_TEXT`, `CANDIDATE_ID`, `DRIVE_PATH`, `RELEVANCE_SCORE`, `LICENSE_CONFIDENCE`, `GEOGRAPHIC_CONFIDENCE`, `SOURCE_STATUS`, and `NOTES`.

Allowed `SOURCE_STATUS` values:

- `NOT_SEARCHED`
- `NO_SUITABLE_FREE_ASSET_FOUND`
- `CANDIDATES_FOUND`
- `SOURCE_IDENTIFIED_MANUAL_DOWNLOAD`
- `DOWNLOADED_TO_DRIVE`
- `SELECTED_CANDIDATE`
- `REQUIRES_CUSTOM_PRODUCTION`

`SELECTED_CANDIDATE` remains a historical sourcing status. Current authorization is controlled by the Section 6A.3 production states above.

## Section 6A candidate pool

**SUPERSEDED BY SECTION 6A.1 FOR CANDIDATE BREADTH.** The compact table below is the historical first-pass shortlist and must not be interpreted as the complete current library. The authoritative expanded pool is [assets/ASSET_CANDIDATE_CATALOG.md](assets/ASSET_CANDIDATE_CATALOG.md); family counts and canonical-role implications are in [assets/ASSET_SOURCING_MATRIX.md](assets/ASSET_SOURCING_MATRIX.md); exact license records are in [assets/LICENSES_AND_PROVENANCE.md](assets/LICENSES_AND_PROVENANCE.md).

Historical Section 6A.1 discovery state:

- unique candidate records: **282**;
- unique current-pool source candidates archived in Drive: **54**;
- valid linked/manual-download candidates: **228**;
- production approvals at that time: **0**;
- `SELECTED` folders populated at that time: **NO**.

## Reuse families and production restraint

1. **Product master family:** One final coherent pack master per coffee may feed `HOME-PROD-*`, `SHOP-*`, `PDP-*-HERO/PACK`, cart thumbnails, and related cards through intentional crops—not separate generations for every slot.
2. **Regional lead family:** Test whether each `S5-FOLIO-*-LEAD-D/M` can also serve `ORIGINS-CARD-*`, `ORIGIN-*-HERO`, `HOME-ORIGIN-*`, or Edition leads. Do not force reuse when crop/content purpose conflicts.
3. **Regional supporting family:** Process/work/botanical plates may support both dossiers and Editions when the same factual context is intended. Captions and identity claims remain page-specific.
4. **Kiln Cup master family:** Preserve one geometry across `HOME-PROD-05`, `SHOP-KILN-01`, `CUP-*`, cart, and pairing imagery. Material macro and hand/ritual scenes remain separate views.
5. **Material family:** A final material study may support Continuum, About, transitions, and optional Folio plane; use crops/texture treatments rather than many near-duplicates.
6. **Never bake type into images.** Packaging labels, folio numbers, captions, metadata, and marks are added in code/design.

## Manifest fields

`D/M ratio` are composition targets, not immutable exports. `Geo` and `People` values indicate mandatory sensitivity review. `Final file` remains `[TBD]` until Section 6.

## Section 6 readiness gates

- [ ] Final product geometry and packaging identity approved before product-family generation.
- [ ] Final coffee names are not required inside images; code-applied labels remain preferred.
- [ ] Folio lead reuse study completed before creating separate Home/Origins/Dossier/Edition landscapes.
- [ ] Regional subject/caption briefs fact-checked before geographic generation.
- [ ] People imagery has identity/representation disclosure rules and no real-person implication.
- [ ] Dedicated mobile crops identified from actual focal tests, not ratio assumptions alone.
- [ ] Optional assets are tied to a validated page composition; no “asset because slot exists” production.
- [ ] Final file naming, formats, dimensions, compression, and rights/provenance fields added in Section 6.
