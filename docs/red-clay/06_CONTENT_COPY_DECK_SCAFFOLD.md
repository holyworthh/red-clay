# Red Clay Coffee — Content & Copy Deck Scaffold

**Status:** Structure for final content pass. Provisional copy is preserved only where canonical sources support it. Placeholders must remain visibly unresolved in authoring data; production UI should not expose raw tags.

**Catalogue change note (2026-10-28):** The Current Harvest coffees were renamed in code (`src/content/coffees.ts`). The product constants and CTAs below now use the current names, slugs, and values from code; the earlier `KENYA LOT 01` / `BURUNDI LOT 01` / `ETHIOPIA LOT 01–02` working IDs are superseded.

| Former name (former slug) | Earlier working name | Current name | Current slug | Lot code in code |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| KIAMBU / WASHED 01 (`kiambu-washed-01`) | Kenya Lot 01 (`kenya-lot-01`) | Plum Season | `/shop/plum-season` | RC / CH / 01 |
| KIRINYAGA / WASHED 02 (`kirinyaga-washed-02`) | — | Cane Light | `/shop/cane-light` | RC / CH / 02 |
| KAYANZA / WASHED 01 (`kayanza-washed-01`) | Burundi Lot 01 (`burundi-lot-01`) | Honey Bloom | `/shop/honey-bloom` | RC / CH / 03 |
| KAYANZA / NATURAL 02 (`kayanza-natural-02`) | — | Red Orchard | `/shop/red-orchard` | RC / CH / 04 |
| SIDAMA / WASHED 01 (`sidama-washed-01`) | Ethiopia Lot 01 (`ethiopia-lot-01`) | Jasmine Air | `/shop/jasmine-air` | RC / CH / 05 |
| GUJI / NATURAL 02 (`guji-natural-02`) | Ethiopia Lot 02 (`ethiopia-lot-02`) | Blue Hour | `/shop/blue-hour` | RC / CH / 06 |

All former slugs permanently redirect to the current slugs (`next.config.ts`). Laterite, Basalt, Linen (The Material Series), Afterlight, Red Clay Instant — Ethiopia, Three Regions, and The Kiln Cup (handleless) are unchanged.
